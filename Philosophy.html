  <p style="color:white; font-size: 20px"> Nietzsche's philosophy is a philosophy of how to view 'truth' or what is known as the philosophy of perspectivism.
  Nietzsche is also known as "the murderer of God" (in Also sprach Zarathustra).
He provoked and criticized Western culture in his day (by reviewing all values and traditions or Umwertung aller Werten) which was largely influenced by Plato's thinking and Christian tradition (both referring to the paradigm of life after death, according to him anti and pessimistic about life).
However, with God's death following the paradigm of life after death, Nietzsche's philosophy did not become a philosophy of nihilism.
On the contrary, it is a philosophy to conquer nihilism1 (Überwindung der Nihilismus) by loving whole life (Lebensbejahung) and positioning man as a human after Übermensch with the will to rule (der Wille zur Macht).</p>
  <p style="color:white; font-size: 20px"> In addition, Nietzsche was known as a philosopher of artists (Künstlerphilosoph) and inspired many modern European painters in the early 20th century, such as Franz Marc, Francis Bacon, and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as writers such as Robert Musil, and Thomas Mann. According to Nietzsche, art activities are metaphysical activities that have the ability to transform the tragedy of life.
